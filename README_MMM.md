Melissa's Project Identifying Trunckating Variants 

My name is Melissa Meredith, I am a 29 year old a Molecular Biology major at California State University, Monterey Bay.
I am a Big Data 2 Knowledge (BD2K) Scholar working with Dr. Melissa Cline. 

This is my first summer research experience, I will spend the next 5 weeks developing and verifying code to identify variants that will produce truncated proteins.
